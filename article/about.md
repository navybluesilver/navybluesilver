# About

## Traditional banking
During my previous job I was given the opportunity to develop the following technical profile:

* 7+ years of work experience as a Financial Services Senior Consultant
* Experience with data warehousing and ETL
* Ensuring that the product is aligned to current client needs, as well as expanding the product to meet new requirements as they occur
* Experience with regulatory reporting, accounting and financial product control
* Excellent SQL skills

## Bitcoin rabbit hole
Recently I have decided to pursue a career that is more in line with my views:

* Politics: https://activism.net/cypherpunk/crypto-anarchy.html
* Technology: https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf
* Economics: https://www.mises.org/

## Bitcoin experience
Since then I started dipping my toes into the open source and bitcoin ecosystem:

* Running a bitcoin full node and protecting my private keys
* Getting familiar with PGP, linux, golang and postgresql
* Running lnd and do lightning payments
* Develop a website to share my views on bitcoin: [navybluesilver.net](http://navybluesilver.net)
* Integrate lightning donations to that website: [navybluesilver.net/donate](http://navybluesilver.net/donate)
* Share the website code on [github](https://github.com/navybluesilver/navybluesilver)
* Basic portfolio risk management via options and futures during the bear market
* Automated arbitrage of altcoin future spreads (experimental code written in golang that exploits inefficient markets with high premiums on futures)

## Available
Currently I am looking for a full time project:

* a project that helps bitcoin become:
  * a better store of value that cannot be confiscated with a predictable restricted supply
  * a better medium of exchange that allows us to transact globally without intermediary, without censorship at a very low cost
  * a better unit of account that acts as the reserve currency for the crypto currency ecosystem, provides financial inclusion for everybody and becomes more stable as it becomes more liquid
* discounted rate if paid in bitcoin; a higher discount if the payment is done via a lightning invoice
* working remotely if possible, but relocation can be discussed (during my previous career I was employed in more than 7 countries)
