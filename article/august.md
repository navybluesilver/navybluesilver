* All the blocks comply with the [monetary policy](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/images/en/4/42/Controlled_supply-supply_over_block_height.png)
* No double spending, debit is equal to credit
* No backdated/manual adjustments
* 0 transactions have been censored
* 0 bitcoins have been confiscated

## Geopolitics

### On Digital money
Most money is digital. Even most of the United States Dollar is stored in a database. For example, [92% of the broad money ](https://money.visualcapitalist.com/worlds-money-markets-one-visualization-2017/) is *not* being printed on bills (or coins). It does not have a hardcopy. Instead it is being inserted into a database and only exists in digital format via a soft-copy. With this context, we will consider money and data to be the same thing. Good money is good data and when we have bad data, we have bad money.

### On regulation
We define regulation as a system that establishes a set of rules and a process that ensures that the participating individuals follow those rules.

### On masterkeys
A masterkey is a key that has the ability to decrypt all messages, censor all transactions and confiscate any money within the system. Regardless of political opinion and whether or not this imposes a system of totalitarian financial surveillance, it is a fact that such a system is a security issue. A masterkey can be (and will be) stolen or compromised. The system is not capable of regulating the ownership of the masterkey itself.

### Traditional regulation
The traditional banking system does not use proof of work to ensure that the rules are being followed. In theory the system relies on a centralized authority to approve (provide signature) of the ledgers reported by its subjects. In practice however, the data is being stored on a large number of mutable files stored in different geographical locations and jurisdictions. There is not one database for the traditional money. There is no USD database, nor EUR database. There is *no single point of truth*. The data is being managed by different parties. The problem of double spending occurs (also see (Two Generals Problem)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Generals%27_Problem]). From a technical point of view, this means that different data sources contradict eachother. As a result, we will find that the following processes are needed to regulate the network:
* reconciliation between different data sources
* adjustments of incorrect data with audit trail
* purging and archiving of historical data; it is not feasible for a regulator to store every single financial transaction themselves
* there is no cryptographic proof that the money/data exists; it relies on approval of the regulator
* there is no cryptographic proof of who owns the money; again it relies on the judgment of the regulator

All of the above can also be classified as operational risk, counterparty/credit risk and (eventually) market risk. One cannot know sure that the counterpary can pay back its debt.

### On Bitcoin regulators
Bitcoin has regulation. You are the regulator. You verify that the rules are being followed. Each individual runs a node which helps to regulate the network. The node checks if the rules are being followed. Any transaction (or journal) that does not comply with the rules will be rejected by the node and effectively by the network itself.

Here are some examples of data that would be rejected:
* over issuance of monetary supply
* double spending; debit not equal to credit
* backdated journals

### On mining, solving the problem and providing a solution
Verifying the network should not be confused with mining. Mining is the process of finding the solution, while verifying is the process of checking if the solution is correct. The proof of work problem is a problem that is difficult to solve, but easy to verify. Because mining is so expensive, the algorithm gives the miner an incentive. The miner that solves the problem receives bitcoin that is derived from (1) transaction fees that individuals assign to their transaction and (2) the predefined blockreward (a restricted predictable declining supply rate).

### On running a full node, verifying the solution
Verifying the ledger (by running a full node) is not expensive. The cost of running a full node is (1) local data storage and computing power; and (2) access to the network. (1) can be done with hardware that costs less than 150USD and (2) can use your existing internet connection (a recurring cost) or by buying a satellite dish (a fixed cost); the latter being a lot cheaper.

### The importance of confidence and money

12. The Limitation on the Issuance of Fiduciary Media

It was a serious blunder to believe that the reserve's task is to provide the means for the redemption of those banknotes the holders of which have lost confidence in the bank. *The confidence which a bank and the money-substitutes it has issued enjoy is indivisible. It is either present with all its clients or it vanishes entirely.* If some of the clients lose confidence, the rest of them lose it too. No bank issuing fiduciary media and granting circulation credit can fulfill the obligations which it has taken over in issuing money-substitutes if all clients are losing confidence and want to have their banknotes redeemed and their deposits paid back. This is an essential feature or weakness of the business of issuing fiduciary media and granting circulation credit. No system of reserve policy and no reserve requirements as enforced by the laws can remedy it. All that a reserve can do is to make it possible for the bank to withdraw from the market an excessive amount of fiduciary media issued. If the bank has issued more banknotes than its clients can use in doing business with other clients, it must redeem such an excess.

### Signatures
The confidence in money is provided by the signature of the system. In the traditional banking system the signature is provided a group of individuals (the regulator). While in Bitcoin, a cryptographic signature is provide.

### On Bitcoin succeeding
Whether or not Bitcoin can achieve its goal (in this context, becoming the world reserve currency) will depend on the fact that the market has more confidence in cryptography and the laws of thermodynamics than it has in a group of individuals (the regulator, central planner or authority).

### On cryptographic regulatory reports
A public company should be able to provide regulatory reports (balance sheet, income statement, etc) that can be cryptographically verified. We cannot regulate the financial system without bitcoin.
