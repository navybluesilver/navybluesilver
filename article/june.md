#### Layer 2: Discreet Log Contracts

Discreet Log Contracts are a system of smart contracts which addresses the scalability and privacy concerns; and seeks to minimize the trust required in the oracle which provides external data:

* The original [whitepaper](https://adiabat.github.io/dlc.pdf) from MIT
* [Explanation and Demo by MIT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VAPotcB9Dc&t=69s)

It enables:
* Trading futures (or more complex derivatives) via bitcoin on any asset
* An authority (the oracle) is (only) trusted to communicate the correct price
* No custodial risk, no centralized exchange that can get hacked
* Scalability using HTLC (similar scaling as lightning)
* The two counterparties in the contract don't have to trust each other, no counterparty risk
* The oracle does not need to be aware of the contract (privacy)

## Economics

### Bitcoin in Backwardation

Since 2018-06-22 the bitcon futures are trading in backwardation. This means that BTC trades at a discount in the future. The market is willing to pay more bitcoin for USD in the future. This is not normal, because in the long term USD is not going to appreciate against BTC. This is an indicator that a lot of people are shorting BTC. People are starting to sell high to buy low, this only works until you run out of sellers. Compare it to last year, when people were buying bitcoin low to sell high. It is the greater fool theory and an indicator that we are approaching the bottom (imo).

Update: There was a short squeeze on 2018-06-29 and now the market is back in contango (futures trading at premium)
