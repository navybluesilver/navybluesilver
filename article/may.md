# May 2018 Update

## Technological

#### Layer 1: bitcoin blockchain

* A block was generated every 10 minutes (on average) since January 9, 2009
* All the blocks comply with the [monetary policy](https://en.bitcoin.it/w/images/en/4/42/Controlled_supply-supply_over_block_height.png)
* No double spending, debit is equal to credit
* No backdated/manual adjustments
* 0 transactions have been censored
* 0 bitcoins have been confiscated
* [Low fees on the blockchain. About 5 satoshi per byte.](https://jochen-hoenicke.de/queue/#0,30d)


#### Layer 2: Lightning network

* The lightning network helps bitcoin to scale off-chain and also enables some other [features](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/future-bitcoin-what-lightning-could-look/).
* The node count has increased from 1511 to 2044. Checkout the [LN mainnet explorer](https://lnmainnet.gaben.win/).
* Find my LN node here: [LN donations](http://navybluesilver.net/donate).

#### altcoins

At this point in time, it looks like every altcoin took the bitcoin code and introduced security flaws.
Read the [security threat model](https://github.com/JWWeatherman/bitcoin_security_threat_model) before buying the "next big thing".

Below some recent examples of these security flaws being exploited:

* [Verge](https://www.ccn.com/privacy-coin-verge-succumbs-to-51-attack-again/)
* [Bitcoin gold](https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-gold-hit-by-double-spend-attack-exchanges-lose-millions/)

## Economics

#### Short term bear

As I mentioned in April, I think this is a choppy bearish market. It will remain a bear market until people who don't want to own bitcoin, stop buying bitcoin. We have to go through a period of despair first. There are two ways in which we can achieve despair. The first way is by a big drop in the price. The second way is via time, meaning a slow decline until people stop caring (similar to late 2014 or early 2015). The more likely situation in my opinion is the second one, because it is more painful. Markets are not designed to give us a free lunch. They follow the 80/20 rule. 80% of the profit goes to 20% of the people.

#### Financial Instruments

The following financial instruments make sense when the capital has enough exposure to the underlying (bitcoin). For individuals who have smaller positions, it might be better just to buy and hold (HODL). As I mentiond before, the market is not designed to give us a free lunch. The chance of a trader to outperform the market is really low.

Bitcoiners can't rely on authority to bail us out. We need to manage the risks ourselves. Figure out what the value of one Bitcoin is worth to you and act accordingly. Here are some tools that can help you:

* [future contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futures_contract) allow you to hedge your position; during a rally the premium is usually nice and fat; this can be traded here [bitmex](https://bitmex.com)
* [option contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_contract) allow you to gain profit when the market goes side ways or "choppy"; this can be traded here [deribit](https://deribit.com)

#### Long term bull

The reason why I store my money in bitcoin is because it is protected against confiscation, censorship resistant and it has a restricted predictable supply. This is achieved by controlling my own private keys and by verifying the database (=blockchain) myself by running a full node. Bitcoin cannot be regulated by authority. It is being regulated by the market. It is a system of rules without rulers. That (to me) is valuable.

I do not consider any other virtual/digital money including fiat (EUR, USD, ...) or altcoins (XRP, ETH, ...) to be private property, because we have historical examples of confiscation, censorship and its money supply being inflated.

#### When "return to mean"?

The vast majority of the "money" trusts (either knowingly or unknowingly) their government and their central bank, therefor it does not feel the need to protect itself. This capital does not feel like it needs bitcoin, because it is not being confiscated, censored or hyper-inflated. The bitcoin fundamentals will become stronger if we see (more):

* inflation above 5% (hidden tax without due process)
* negative interest rates (pushing savers to other assets)
* cash bans or introduction of "cryptocurrencies/blockchains" issued by financial institutions or nation states (totalitarian financial surveillance)
* capital controls, blocking certain payments (censorship)

Note that all of the above trigger *a need for capital to protect itself against confiscation, censorship and increased supply*. Some of this is happening today, but that news has already been priced in (Venezuela/Argentina/Zimbabwe hyperinflation, India demonetization, Japan negative rates, China capital controls,...).

#### The bright side of a bear market

People buy bitcoin during a bull market, because it is going up. People don't want to buy during a bear market, because it is going down. This is perfectly normal psychological behavior. But of course if you want to buy low and sell high, you should be thinking the other way around. Here are some positive things about the bear market:

* Cheaper coins!
* Buy the rumor, sell the news; there is a rumor called the [lightning network](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/future-bitcoin-what-lightning-could-look/)
* The whales are buying lambos by selling bitcoin, decentralizing the ownership of bitcoin, creating less whales
* People are not calling bitcoin a "ponzi scheme" anymore
* More skepticism, less media attention, more participation in development, focus on technology and eventually a return to mean

##### bitcoin manipulation
Is it possible that an whale colludes with the media before he does a big dump? Yes and it should not be too surprising:

* [Bloomberg](https://twitter.com/lowstrife/status/999567072790171650)
* [CNBC](https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/998654498418581506)

But I don't think there is anything systemic going on, not unless I see the data that proves it. All the exchanges that I know share their order books to the public (via API) and the blockchain is also public. It should be easy enough to prove it.

The idea that the bitcoin price is being manipulated seems very unlikely to me. It is being traded on a few regulated exchanges, on hundreds of unregulated exchanges, on OTC markets including localbitcoins, bisq, paxful,... These (independent) markets are located in many different geographical locations... and somehow this is being controlled/manipulated by a handful of traders in some gigantic conspiracy. This is a bear market so the price would be manipulated to the downside... Which brings the question, why would a bitcoin whale want to reduce the value of his own assets? The incentives don't align.

Bitcoin can't be "manipulated" for the same reasons that it can't be regulated. We have a free market.

##### altcoin manipulation
It is entirely possible that the price of an altcoin is being manipulated (depending on how centralized it is). The vast majority of these coins are only being traded on a handful of exchanges.

##### fiat manipulation
Fun fact, fiat is being manipulated by design by a selected group of individuals (Mr. Powell and friends).
